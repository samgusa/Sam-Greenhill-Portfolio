## Warning Light Camera <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/warning-light-camera/id1465343815?ls=1" target="_blank"><img src="assets/icon.png" width="20" title="Warning Light Camera"></a>

[Warning Light Camera](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/warning-light-camera/id1465343815?ls=1) is an encyclopedia of dashboard lights from most vehicles on the road today. Using XCode's CreateML to produce an image recognition app that can actually identify the possible warning lights that have appeared. Each light comes with a detailed description, cause, procedure to turn off, as well as telling you the most important question, Can I Still Drive?
