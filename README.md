Everyone has been in this situation, your driving around and then suddenly, a light appears on the dashboard. You look through the think manual the dealership gave you, but you still don't understand how to turn it off or more importantly, is it safe to drive? [Warning Light Camera](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/warning-light-camera/id1465343815?ls=1) is the answer to that problem. This is my first app, developed entirely by me, from design, icons, images, and updates.
